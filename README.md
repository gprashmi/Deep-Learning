This repository consists of various concept based notebook in Deep Learning. 

### Regression_MLP
To build a deep MLP model for regression task on prediction of house value using California Housing dataset. It introduces the Keras Tuner library
that is used to perform hyper-parameter tuning on the neural network. Using the Keras tuner, the best model searched through HyperBand Tuner had 25.31% decrease in 
the test error compared to the baseline model.
